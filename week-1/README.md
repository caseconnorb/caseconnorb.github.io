For this assignment, I decided to make a picture of a man. This allowed me to use a wide variety of shapes in a coherent picture while still keeping my product simple. Most of the coding for the shapes wasn't that difficult; I used the p5 reference website to discover any methods I wasn't familiar with or was confused about. Figuring out how to move the files to the website was a bit tricky, but I eventually managed that, as well.

This assignment helped me figure out some of the workings of p5, GitHub, and SourceTree, and as such, I found it quite useful.
